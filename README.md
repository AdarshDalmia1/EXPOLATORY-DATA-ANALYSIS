# EXPOLATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-LOAN-DATASET
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) case study on Lending Club's loan data. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, uncover insights, and identify patterns that can inform business decisions and strategies. Through this case study, we will explore various aspects of the data, including loan status, borrower characteristics, and loan attributes.
Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in the data science process, used to summarize the main characteristics of the data and uncover hidden insights. This project demonstrates the process of EDA using Python and its powerful libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Objectives
Understand the distribution and structure of the dataset
Identify key features influencing loan status
Analyze borrower characteristics and their impact on loan approval and default rates
Visualize data trends and patterns
Provide actionable insights for business improvement
